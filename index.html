  <p>A painter and writer since leaving home at 16 in 1979, Lawrence Freiesleben has lived in the wilds of the North Pennines in Northumberland with his wife and the youngest of his children, for the past six years. His most recent exhibition was online with the International Times and the <em>“atmospheric abstracts”</em> (for want of a better term) featured, were partially inspired by the ruined landscapes of the lead mining industry, high on the moors. Before moving north, he and his family lived in North Devon for thirteen years, and before that at various locations all over Britain, <em>“for just long enough to remain unsettled!”</em></p>

      <p class="quote"><em>“It had long been his hope that the shadow would accede to the fully defined. At moments it happened in the most unexpected of his paintings – beyond their ‘abstract’ and far beyond all the futile efforts of representation.” (from Estuary and Shadow).</em></p>
      <p>When I started in 1976, my paintings were fairly straightforward representations of the countryside to which I escaped in the evenings or at weekends from the pointless nightmare of school. Each new one served as a talisman against the emptiness of ‘education’. (How much emptier the process has since become!)</p>
      <p> Over the years they grew in complexity (or is it simplicity?): For a long period, rather than copying a specific location, their aim was rather to represent the essence of a place: a headland, a tor on Dartmoor, a high field . . . More recently, those I consider most valid, use time and place only as a jumping off point. Searching for places in landscape where there appears to be a thinness in the surface of appearances, they attempt to go beyond this threshold.</p>
